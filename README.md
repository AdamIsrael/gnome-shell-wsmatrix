# Workspace Matrix

GNOME shell extension to arrange workspaces in a two-dimensional grid.

This is a clone of the [Workspace Grid](https://github.com/zakkak/workspace-grid) extension. I was not able to wrap my head around Workspace Grid so I started to implement my own extension to get the features I wanted.

## Features

- Freely configure the number of rows and columns of the two-dimensional workspace grid.
