This is a clone of the [Workspace Grid](https://github.com/zakkak/workspace-grid) extension. I was not able to wrap my head around Workspace Grid so I started to implement my own extension to get the features I wanted.

## Features

- Configurable number of rows and columns of the workspace grid.
- Workspace thumbnails with live previews of the workspaces (optional).
- Configurable scale of the workspace thumbnails.
- Workspace overview on <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.
